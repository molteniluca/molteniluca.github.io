          <p>This post should have been written at least three years ago, but here we are.</p>
<p>At the end of 2021, while stuck at home with COVID and confined within my four walls, I was watching YouTube videos while my mom had the TV tuned to the italic <code>Canale 5</code>.</p>
<p>What caught my attention was that even though Italy was still broadcasting in low-quality SD (580p) in 2022, a banner on the screen appeared to be rendered at a much higher resolution. Even stranger: during the entire previous week of isolation, that banner never showed up.</p>
<p>The only difference?
This time, the TV was connected to my phone’s hotspot.</p>
<h2 id="the-curiosity-spark">The Curiosity Spark</h2>
<p>I started inspecting the Grande Fratello (Big Brother) banner.
With a very janky setup, I:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fired up my phone’s USB hotspot.</li>
<li>Connected my laptop to that.</li>
<li>Created a Wi-Fi hotspot on the laptop and connected the TV to it.</li>
<li>Started sniffing traffic with Wireshark.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once the TV tuned to the correct station, I saw that:</p>
<ul>
<li>DNS queries were made to Mediaset’s servers.</li>
<li>Subsequent requests were plain old HTTP (yep, no HTTPS).</li>
<li>Among the resources fetched? <code>.class</code> files. Yes <code>.class</code> files in plain HTTP.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-tv">The TV</h2>
<p>Some quick context on the victim device here: it is an LG TV 43UF6407 and it uses the WebOS 2.0 operating system.
This TV does not support HbbTV but it supports MHP a protocol only known in Italy and a few other countries in its DVB-T form.</p>
<h2 id="the-exploit">The Exploit</h2>
<p>So I inspected and reversed some of those .class files, then patched one to execute arbitrary commands.</p>
<p>Steps I took:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hosted one my patched .class file.</li>
<li>Changed DNS records on my laptop.</li>
<li>Fired up a local web server.</li>
</ul>
<p>When the TV booted and tuned to the channel, it fetched my resources and executed the command inside the .class file:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>curl http://mylaptop.lan/pwned
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>I immediately saw the request on my laptop — confirming remote code execution.
Next, I swapped the payload to start a telnet daemon:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>telnetd -l /bin/sh -F
</span></span></code></pre></div><h2 id="the-surprise">The Surprise</h2>
<p>Upon connecting to the telnet endpoint, I wanted to attempt privilege escalation.
The surprise?</p>
<p>I was <em>already root</em>.</p>
<p>So this protocol already executes untrusted code in a JVM sandbox. The LG implementation even contains the exec API (which is not even required by the MHP standard).</p>
<p>And they also executed everything <em>as root</em>.</p>
<h2 id="bigger-picture-the-mhp-problem">Bigger Picture: The MHP Problem</h2>
<p>Here’s the scarier part.</p>
<p>The MHP standard (Multimedia Home Platform) — the thing that makes all this possible — is used by tons of TVs in Italy.</p>
<p>The first .class file is actually sent nationwide through DVB-T broadcasts.</p>
<p>This could mean that a malicious attacker with a rogue DVB-T transmitter could broadcast a malicious .class file to any nearby TVs?</p>
<p>Actually the MHP protocol has some kind of signature checking to determine API priviledges but I could not verify how the TV would react under the more restricted circumstances, being that I do not own a DVB-T transmitter nor a faraday cage to not get in trouble.</p>
<h2 id="aftermath">Aftermath</h2>
<p>So all in all this was a cool vulnerability that could be further explored, in the meantime with root access, I installed the alternative app store on my TV using my own method.
And that’s how the Grande Fratello banner led me to owning an LG TV.</p>
<h2 id="responsible-disclosure">Responsible Disclosure</h2>
<p>This vulnerability has been reported to LG which assessed the problem but did not fix it since it does affect only devices released until 2016.</p>
